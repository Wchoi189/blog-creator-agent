# AgentQMS Artifact Workflow — Assessment and Recommendations

## Executive Summary

The AgentQMS artifact workflow provides reliable validation of file-naming and directory conventions and offers actionable rename/move suggestions. In two batches of 10 changes each, the validator consistently detected violations and confirmed improvements, increasing compliance from 78% → 98.3% without false positives observed in the tested scope. However, the workflow currently focuses on structural conventions (paths and filenames) and does not automatically refactor index links or in-text references when files are renamed or moved. Error messaging around artifact types and separators can be confusing, and there is no one-shot “auto-fix” mode to apply suggested changes safely with a limit/preview.

Overall reliability is good for naming/directory rules, but medium for end-to-end documentation integrity due to missing link integrity checks and automated reference updates.

## What Works Well

- Naming/directory checks: Consistently flags invalid artifact type forms and wrong locations.
- Suggestions: Clear “Rename file to follow convention” and “Move file to correct directory” guidance.
- Determinism: Re-runs of `make validate` reflect state accurately after changes.
- Scope hygiene: Validation avoids intrusive content changes (safe by default).

## Points of Confusion and Pain

- Mixed separators by artifact type: `implementation_plan_` uses underscore, while `assessment-` uses hyphen; `BUG_` / `SESSION_` are uppercase prefixes. This inconsistency creates cognitive overhead and avoidable mistakes.
- Error wording: Files like `assessment_security-audit.md` are reported as “Missing valid artifact type” though the issue is the separator format (`assessment-` expected). Message should differentiate “invalid format” vs “missing type”.
- Partial coverage: The validator does not check that frontmatter `type:` matches the artifact type implied by the filename, nor does it validate whether a file is placed in a directory that semantically matches its frontmatter `type` (e.g., completion summary stored under `completed_plans/implementation_plans/`).
- Link rot after renames: Index pages and in-body Markdown links are not auto-updated. After the moves/renames, several index links and inline references required manual edits.
- Batch-apply friction: No built-in “apply suggestions” mode with a limit (e.g., apply first N renames/moves) and dry-run.

## Observed Bugs / Gaps

- Directory-only rule triggered while frontmatter/type mismatch went unchecked. Example: A completion summary was flagged only for directory placement; its `type: completion_summary` and filename beginning with `implementation_plan_` were not cross-validated.
- Duplicate or legacy names (e.g., `bug_report_*` vs `BUG_*`) cause “destination exists” errors during renames; there is no helper to resolve by de-duplicating the older name automatically.
- Index drift: Auto-generated index files claim “Do not edit manually,” yet they can become stale and are not automatically regenerated by `make validate`.

## Areas of Weakness

- Consistency model: Mixed separators and case rules increase failure rate for humans and tools.
- Integrity guarantees: No end-to-end guarantee that all references (indexes and inline links) are valid post-change.
- Limited remediation: Validator suggests changes but does not provide a guided, safe auto-fix pipeline with previews and scoped limits.

## Reliability Assessment

- Structural validation (names/paths): High
- Content–structure coherence (frontmatter vs file type vs directory): Medium-low
- Reference integrity (indexes, inline links): Low (manual work required)
- Overall workflow reliability today: Medium-high for catching structural issues; Medium for complete documentation health.

## Recommendations (Prioritized)

1) Unify and Document Naming Conventions (High)
- Publish a single table mapping artifact types → required prefix, separator, case, and directory. Example:
  - `assessment-...` (lowercase, hyphen) → `docs/artifacts/assessments/`
  - `implementation_plan_...` (lowercase, underscore) → `docs/artifacts/implementation_plans/`
  - `BUG_...` (uppercase, underscore) → `docs/artifacts/bug_reports/`
  - `SESSION_...` (uppercase, underscore) → `docs/artifacts/completed_plans/completion_summaries/session_notes/`
- Add rule hints to error messages to reduce cognitive load.

2) Improve Validator Messages (High)
- Distinguish between “missing artifact type” vs “invalid format for artifact type.”
- When a file is in the wrong directory, include the detected frontmatter `type` and expected directory.

3) Add Frontmatter Cross-Checks (High)
- Validate that frontmatter `type:` aligns with filename prefix and directory. Emit a single consolidated diagnostic when multiple mismatches occur.

4) Add Link Integrity and Index Regeneration (High)
- Provide a `make reindex` target that regenerates all artifact indexes.
- Add a `make check-links` (or include in `make validate`) to verify that:
  - Index links resolve to existing files.
  - Inline Markdown paths referencing artifacts remain valid after renames.

5) Introduce Safe Auto-Fix Mode (Medium)
- `make fix ARGS="--limit 10 --dry-run"` to apply validator suggestions automatically.
- Offer strategies for duplicate conflicts (e.g., prefer canonical `BUG_` over `bug_report_`, remove obsolete duplicate with confirmation).

6) Provide Git Integration Helpers (Medium)
- Add `make commit-fixes MSG="AgentQMS: auto-fix (N files)"` to commit staged changes with a standard message.
- Optional: pre-commit hook to run `make validate` and block non-compliant additions.

7) Developer Experience Polishing (Low)
- Surface a summary table at the end of validation: violations by rule, top offenders, and suggested next command (e.g., `make fix --limit 10`).
- Print the exact expected pattern next to each violation (e.g., `YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM_assessment-descriptive-name.md`).

## Suggested Implementation Plan

- Phase 1: Clarify rules and messages
  - Update rule docs and error text for separator/case consistency.
  - Add a machine-readable schema (JSON/YAML) describing all artifact types and their naming/directories.

- Phase 2: Cross-validation and link checks
  - Implement frontmatter/filename/directory consistency checks.
  - Add link checker and wire `make reindex` into `make validate` or a new `make compliance` target.

- Phase 3: Auto-fix pipeline
  - Build a `validate --json` mode that outputs structured suggestions.
  - Implement `fix` command that consumes JSON and performs safe `git mv`, updates indexes, and rewrites inline links.
  - Add `--limit`, `--dry-run`, `--commit` flags.

## Appendix

- How this assessment was conducted
  - Ran `cd AgentQMS/interface && make validate` repeatedly while renaming/moving up to 20 files in two batches.
  - Observed validator feedback, coverage, and stability; manually updated indexes and one inline reference.
  - Final state reached 98.3% compliance with one remaining directory-placement issue.

- Quick Commands
```bash
cd AgentQMS/interface
make validate              # Validate all artifacts
# Suggested future additions:
make reindex               # Regenerate indexes (proposed)
make check-links           # Verify index + inline links (proposed)
make fix ARGS="--limit 10 --dry-run"  # Safe auto-fix (proposed)
```
